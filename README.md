Create a gallery with the ability to click on its elements and view a full-size image in a modal window.

What the mentor will pay attention to during the review:

- The live page displays a gallery of images from the images data array
- The image gallery is styled according to the layout
- The data for the gallery is created dynamically in JS
- When listening to the event of clicking on gallery elements, the delegation technique is used
- Nothing happens when clicking between gallery elements
- The basicLightbox library is connected
- When clicking on a gallery element, a modal window of the connected library opens, containing an enlarged version of the image that was clicked on
